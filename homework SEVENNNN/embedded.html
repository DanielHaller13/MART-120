<h1 style="color: green;">The Flying Pig</h1>

<p style="color: green;">Once upon a time, there was a pig. The pig wished he could fly. The pig would run and jump off high places and always hurt himself in an attempt to fly. One day he escaped from his pen and ran into the woods. It wasn't long before he found a sinkhole. The pig jumped right in, hoping he would fly. The pig landed harshly at the bottom of the sinkhole, but to his surprise, he started flying up! The pig flew up and out of the sinkhole and above the trees. The pig zoomed past the clouds and soared past the birds. The pig went up and up until he arrived at golden gates.</p>
